BOMservations
=============

An iPhone viewer for BOM observation information

Notes
-----

1. This should be considered quite experimental at this stage.
2. The observation data URL is hard coded to be that of Canterbury Racecourse
3. The app does not limit the frequency of updating from BOM. Be nice, and try not to refresh more than once every 30 minutes. If you are working on this app, please make a copy of the JSON locally and fetch from there.
4. This app should not be submitted to the Apple iPhone/iPad App Store at this time - is not in full compliance with BOM requirements for data use, and it isn't terribly complete anyway. (In its current from it pulls the observation data direct from BOM).
